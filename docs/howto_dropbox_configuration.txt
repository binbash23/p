Enable dropbox connection in p to sync password databases online


It makes sense to synchronize all your p databases (on your windows computer and your linux computer and so on) over an internet connection and a cloud storage. To do so, I implemented a dropbox connection in p.

p will connect to your dropbox account and store a copy of your encrypted password database there. If you run p from another computer you can then synchronize your database on the other computer with the password database copy which is in your dropbox account.

To enable the dropbox connection you have to do some strange stuff.

#1 Create an application in your dropbox account and get the application_key and application_secret If you have done this, you need to save the application_key (as loginname) and application_secret (as password) in the p database and set the account uuid into the p configuration (-z option from p).

#2 Generate and retrieve your application access code

#3 Generate and retrieve the refresh access token for accessing your dropbox account from p If you have done this, you need to save the refresh_access_token in the p database and set the account uuid into the p configuration (-y option from p).

NOTE:

I implemented a procedure which you can follow to do all this. Use:

p.exe -Z

and follow the instructions.

This.is.crazy. Yes. But if you have done all this stuff, you have a cloud enabled password manager...

Now you can synchronize your local password database with your database copy in dropbox with:

p.exe -Y
